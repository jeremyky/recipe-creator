        <p class="lead">Ever opened your pantry only to discover expired items hiding in the back? You're not alone. A well-organized pantry isn't just aesthetically pleasing—it's a money-saver and time-saver that can transform your cooking experience.</p>

        <h2>1. Categorize Everything</h2>
        <p>Start by grouping similar items together. Keep all your grains in one section, canned goods in another, and spices in their own designated area. This simple categorization makes it easy to find what you need and helps you avoid buying duplicates.</p>

        <h2>2. Use Clear Containers</h2>
        <p>Transfer dry goods like flour, sugar, pasta, and rice into clear, airtight containers. Not only does this keep food fresher longer, but you can see at a glance what you have and how much is left. Label each container with the item name and expiration date.</p>

        <h2>3. Master the FIFO Method</h2>
        <p>FIFO stands for "First In, First Out." When you buy new items, place them behind the older ones. This ensures you're always using the oldest products first, reducing the chance of food expiring before you use it.</p>

        <h2>4. Keep a Running Inventory</h2>
        <p>Maintain a digital list on your phone or use Pantry Pilot's built-in pantry tracker. Update it whenever you use or buy items. This eliminates the guesswork when you're at the grocery store and prevents overbuying.</p>

        <h2>5. Maximize Vertical Space</h2>
        <p>Don't waste valuable vertical space! Use shelf risers, stackable bins, or tiered organizers to create multiple levels within your pantry. This can effectively double your storage capacity.</p>

        <h2>6. Add Lazy Susans for Corner Access</h2>
        <p>Those tricky corner cabinets are perfect for lazy Susans. Place items like oils, vinegars, and condiments on a rotating platform so nothing gets lost in the back.</p>

        <h2>7. Label With Dates</h2>
        <p>When you transfer items to containers or open packages, write the purchase date or expiration date on them with a marker. This simple habit helps you track freshness and rotate stock effectively.</p>

        <h2>8. Do Monthly Audits</h2>
        <p>Set a recurring reminder to check your pantry once a month. Move items that are expiring soon to the front, and update your inventory. This 15-minute task can save you hundreds of dollars annually.</p>

        <h2>9. Create a "Use First" Zone</h2>
        <p>Designate one shelf or basket as your "use first" area. Place items nearing expiration here, and make a conscious effort to incorporate them into your meals. Pantry Pilot's smart matching can help you find recipes specifically designed to use these ingredients.</p>

        <h2>10. Go Digital With Pantry Pilot</h2>
        <p>While physical organization is crucial, digital tracking takes it to the next level. Pantry Pilot automatically reminds you when items are running low, suggests recipes based on what you have, and helps you plan meals around expiring ingredients. It's like having a personal pantry manager!</p>

          <h3>💡 Pro Tip</h3>
          <p>Remember: a visible pantry is a usable pantry. If you can't see it, you won't use it. Keep frequently used items at eye level and less common items on higher or lower shelves.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>An organized pantry isn't about perfection—it's about functionality. Start with one or two of these tips, and gradually implement more as you develop new habits. The goal is to create a system that works for your lifestyle and helps you waste less, save more, and cook better meals.</p>

        <p>With these strategies and Pantry Pilot's smart pantry tracking, you'll always know what you have, what you need, and what delicious meals you can create right now.</p>
