        <p class="lead">Getting generic recipe suggestions that don't match your style? Your AI is only as smart as the data you give it. Let's change that and unlock truly personalized recommendations.</p>

        <h2>Understanding How the AI Learns</h2>
        <p>Pantry Pilot's AI uses machine learning to understand your preferences, cooking habits, and ingredient availability. Every interaction you have—searching, rating, favoriting, or even skipping recipes—teaches the system more about you. The key is being intentional with these interactions.</p>

        <h2>Rate Recipes Honestly</h2>
        <p>This is the single most important thing you can do. When you make a recipe, rate it honestly on a 1-5 star scale. The AI uses these ratings to understand what you like:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>5 stars:</strong> Absolutely loved it, make again</li>
          <li><strong>4 stars:</strong> Really good, would recommend</li>
          <li><strong>3 stars:</strong> Fine, but not special</li>
          <li><strong>2 stars:</strong> Not my taste</li>
          <li><strong>1 star:</strong> Disliked, don't show similar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Don't just rate everything 5 stars to be nice—variety in your ratings helps the AI distinguish your true favorites from the rest.</p>

        <h2>Use Specific Search Terms</h2>
        <p>Instead of vague searches like "chicken" or "pasta," try specific queries that capture your intent:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>❌ Bad: "dinner"</li>
          <li>✅ Good: "quick weeknight chicken dinner under 30 minutes"</li>
          <li>❌ Bad: "pasta"</li>
          <li>✅ Good: "creamy vegetarian pasta for date night"</li>
          <li>❌ Bad: "dessert"</li>
          <li>✅ Good: "chocolate dessert that uses bananas"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The more context you provide, the better the AI can match your needs.</p>

        <h2>Keep Your Pantry Updated</h2>
        <p>The AI can't recommend recipes with ingredients you don't have! Make it a habit to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Update your pantry when you go shopping</li>
          <li>Mark items as "out of stock" when you use them up</li>
          <li>Use the barcode scanner (coming soon!) for quick updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An accurate pantry means the AI can focus on recipes you can actually make right now, not theoretical possibilities.</p>

        <h2>Tag Your Favorites</h2>
        <p>Use custom tags to organize recipes in meaningful ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"family favorite" - Kids love it</li>
          <li>"date night" - Impressive but manageable</li>
          <li>"meal prep" - Great for batch cooking</li>
          <li>"comfort food" - For those cozy nights</li>
          <li>"healthy" - Nutritious options</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Over time, the AI learns these context patterns. Ask for a "family favorite" and it'll know what you mean.</p>

        <h2>Master the Chat Feature</h2>
        <p>The AI chat is incredibly powerful when you use it right. Compare these queries:</p>
        
        <div class="article-callout">
          <h3>Basic Query</h3>
          <p>"What should I make for dinner?"</p>
          <h3>Power User Query</h3>
          <p>"I have 30 minutes, chicken thighs in my fridge, feeling something spicy with Asian flavors, and I need to use up this bell pepper before it goes bad. What can I make?"</p>
        </div>

        <p>The second query gives the AI everything it needs: time constraint, main ingredient, flavor profile, and specific items to use. The result will be dramatically better.</p>

        <h2>Explore "Surprise Me"</h2>
        <p>Occasionally use the "surprise me" or "feeling adventurous" features. This helps the AI discover patterns you didn't know you had. You might think you hate fish, but maybe you've just never had it prepared the right way. Let the AI challenge your assumptions sometimes.</p>

        <h2>Provide Feedback on Suggestions</h2>
        <p>When the AI suggests a recipe, you have options beyond just making it or ignoring it:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Save for later:</strong> Interested but not now</li>
          <li><strong>Not interested:</strong> Teaches the AI to avoid similar recipes</li>
          <li><strong>Tell us why:</strong> "Too complex," "Don't like that ingredient," etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every piece of feedback fine-tunes your future recommendations.</p>

        <h2>Be Patient With the Learning Curve</h2>
        <p>The AI needs at least 10-15 interactions (ratings, searches, saves) before it really understands you. Don't judge it too harshly in the first week. After a month of regular use, the recommendations will feel almost magical.</p>

        <h2>Advanced Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time of Day Matters:</strong> The AI learns your breakfast vs. dinner preferences</li>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Preferences:</strong> It notices what you cook more in summer vs. winter</li>
          <li><strong>Skill Level:</strong> If you consistently skip complex recipes, it'll show simpler ones</li>
          <li><strong>Cooking Methods:</strong> Love your air fryer? The AI will prioritize air fryer recipes</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="article-callout">
          <h3>🎯 Pro Tip</h3>
          <p>Create a "tried and true" collection of your go-to recipes. The AI uses this as your baseline flavor profile to find similar recipes you haven't discovered yet.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Rating everything 5 stars (no useful data)</li>
          <li>Never updating your pantry (AI recommends impossible recipes)</li>
          <li>One-word searches ("chicken" - too vague)</li>
          <li>Ignoring the chat feature (most powerful tool underutilized)</li>
          <li>Giving up after two days (AI needs time to learn)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>The AI is your cooking partner, not a mind reader. The more you communicate—through ratings, searches, tags, and feedback—the better it gets at anticipating your needs. Think of it like training a sous chef: clear instructions and honest feedback create a professional partnership.</p>

        <p>Start with these techniques today, and in a few weeks, you'll wonder how you ever cooked without personalized AI recommendations.</p>
