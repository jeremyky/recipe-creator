  <h2 id="mission-heading">Our Mission</h2>
  <div class="card">
    <p>Pantry Pilot was born from a simple observation: too much food goes to waste because people don't know what to cook with what they have. We believe that everyone should be able to create delicious meals from the ingredients already in their kitchen.</p>
    <p>Our platform helps you:</p>
    <ul style="line-height: 2;">
      <li>Track ingredients in your pantry</li>
      <li>Find recipes that match what you already have</li>
      <li>Discover new dishes based on your preferences</li>
      <li>Reduce food waste by using what you have</li>
      <li>Save and organize your favorite recipes</li>
    </ul>
